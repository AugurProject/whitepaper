# The Augur Project Whitepaper

The Forecast Foundation has an open $500 bounty on white paper translations. You are allowed to have **two** open translations at any time.

### Resources

[[1]](https://www.overleaf.com/read/wchttdcjvjjq) English Whitepaper in LaTeX format. 

[[2]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Jg2vQUsLhwf7upvKFlMq_rWXsUrMuSs8) Overview Diagram in XML format. 

[[3]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rycXJMeqyppaAZtXnddwTXjor8cEBRn8) Reporting Diagram in XML format. 

### Requirements

1. Create an issue if there is an unclaimed language you'd like to translate. You will have 30 days to complete the translation, else your issue will be closed and someone else will be allowed to claim the translation. 

2. Paper must be delivered in LaTeX format, preferably using Overleaf. You can select _"Clone this project"_ on the [English Overleaf resource [1]](https://www.overleaf.com/read/wchttdcjvjjq), and begin working on the translation in your own copy of the paper. 

3. Import the two XML files [[2]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Jg2vQUsLhwf7upvKFlMq_rWXsUrMuSs8) [[3]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rycXJMeqyppaAZtXnddwTXjor8cEBRn8)  into [Draw.io](http://draw.io) and translate the diagrams. They can be exported as a PNG/JPG, and put into Overleaf. 

4. The final delivery needs to be an Overleaf link with your translation. Comment on your issue that it is complete, along with a payment address and currency of choice (ETH, REP, BTC).
